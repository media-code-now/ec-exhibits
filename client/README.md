# EC Portal Client (Prototype)

React + Tailwind dashboard for the EC Exhibits client portal concept. Demonstrates progress tracking, invoices, file uploads, and realtime messaging.

## Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Start the companion server from `../server` first. Launch the client on `http://localhost:5173`, pick a demo persona, and switch between projects to see mocked data alongside live messaging + upload flows.
